Abstract
This study proposes a novel hybrid retrieval strategy for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that integrates cosine similarity and cosine distance measures to improve retrieval performance, particularly for sparse data. The traditional cosine similarity measure is widely used to capture the similarity between vectors in high-dimensional spaces. However, it has been shown that this measure can yield arbitrary results in certain scenarios. To address this limitation, we incorporate cosine distance measures to provide a complementary perspective by quantifying the dissimilarity between vectors. Our approach is experimented on proprietary data, unlike recent publications that have used open-source datasets. The proposed method demonstrates enhanced retrieval performance and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic relationships between documents or items. This hybrid strategy offers a promising solution for efficiently and accurately retrieving relevant information in knowledge-intensive applications, leveraging techniques such as BM25 (sparse) retrieval , vector (Dense) retrieval, and cosine distance based retrieval to facilitate efficent information retrieval.
Keywords: Large Language Models, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Information Retrieval, GPT, Algorithm.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative technologies with excellent performance on a variety of tasks. With the increasing size of LLMs, they can function as very effective knowledge warehouses [1], with facts embedded within their parameters, and models can be improved further through fine-tuning on domain-specific knowledge. However fine-tuning is a difficult task with vast amounts of data [2]. A different method, first developed in open domain question answering systems [3], involves organizing vast amounts of text into smaller sections (paragraphs) and storing them in a distinct information retrieval system. This system retrieves relevant information, which is then provided to the LLM alongside the question for context. Researchers have also attempted using keywords to augment information retrieval [4] with reported reduction in latency and cost of retrieval [4]. This approach simplifies the process of supplying a system with up-to-date knowledge in a specific domain, while also facilitating easy understanding of where the information comes from. In contrast, the inherent knowledge of LLMs is complex and challenging to trace back to its origin [5].
Nevertheless, existing retrieval-augmented approaches also have flaws. Most practices in retrieval augmented generation or RAG, use vector similarity as semantic similarity, but it has been shown that cosine similarity of learned embeddings can yield arbitrary results [6]. In this study, we propose a hybrid retrieval strategy that integrates cosine similarity and cosine distance measures to enhance retrieval performance. Traditional cosine similarity measures have been widely utilized to capture the similarity between vectors in high-dimensional spaces. However, in scenarios where the similarity measure fails to adequately capture the semantic relationship between documents or items, cosine distance provides a complementary perspective by quantifying the dissimilarity between vectors. We demonstrate how this approach improves retrieval specifically for sparse data.
Our proposed method towards RAG is experimented on proprietary data, unlike more recent publications [7, 8, 9] which have used open-source datasets like QuALITY [10], MedQA [11], US SEC Filings etc.

2 Methodology
2.1 Data Processing
The HTML pages used in the study and experiments came from https://i-venture.org. A web crawler was set up to methodically obtain all HTML pages, using libraries like requests, re, urllib, BeautifulSoup, collections, and HTML parsing tools. Upon recovery, the HTML pages were converted to text files. Following that, a variety of data preparation techniques were used to remove unnecessary information such as headers and footers, ensuring that the focus remained on the primary textual content.
2.2 Vectorization
The analyzed text files were divided into manageable pieces and then transformed into embeddings using the OpenAI embedding model text-embedding-ada-002. The size of those manageable pieces were optimized so as to achieve higher score on metrics discussed in 2.4. During this procedure, entities were extracted for use as metadata in question answering [12]. The generated embedding vectors were systematically stored for further analysis.
2.3 Retrieval
Leveraging the Language Model (LLM) capabilities, user queries were addressed by invoking the assistance of the pre-trained language model, GPT-3.5-TURBO. In instances where the LLM failed to provide satisfactory responses based on contextual information(similarity search), the system seamlessly transitioned to a distance-based approach for query resolution. For RAG, we use a hybrid retriever composed of BM25 retriever coupled with traditional vector retriever and then the retrieved chunks were reordered [13]. BM25 is a widely used information retrieval technique that employs a probabilistic model to rank documents based on the frequency and distribution of query terms within them [14]. The chunks retrieved using distance approach are re-ranked with the help flashrank library [15].
To facilitate the transition between the similarity-based and distance-based approaches, a validation prompt was utilized. This prompt, designed to evaluate the adequacy of responses generated by the initial approach, ensured a seamless and effective switch between methodologies based on the user’s query requirements. Following is the prompt employed:
Validating Prompt
"You are an intelligent bot designed to assist users on an organization’s
website by answering their queries. You’ll be given a user’s question and
an associated answer. Your task is to determine if the provided answer
effectively resolves the query. If the answer is unsatisfactory, return 0.
Query: {query}
Answer: {answer}
Your Feedback:"
2.4 Evaluation
We evaluated our augmented-RAG pipeline on a variety of metrics and compared it with two open source datasets [16, 17]. The evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transitioned from classical metrics like ROUGE, and METEOR[18] to more nuanced metrics [19]. A common issue in evaluating RAG is the unavailability of ground truths. We use answers generated by GPT-4-TURBO as ground truths as it has been demonstrated that LLMs like GPT-4-TURBO are over 80% in agreement with humans and hence can be used as a judge for evaluating a smaller model’s output [20]. The output generated has been evaluated on the following nuanced metrics alongside the classical methods:
Contextual Precision: This metric measures your RAG pipeline’s retriever by evaluating whether nodes in your retrieval context that are relevant to the given query are ranked higher than irrelevant ones.
Contextual Recall: This metric measures the quality of the RAG pipeline’s retriever by evaluating the extent to which the retrieval context aligns with the ground truth.
Contextual Relevancy: This metric measures the quality of the RAG pipeline’s retriever by evaluating the overall relevance of the information presented in your retrieval context for a given query.
Answer Relevancy: The answer relevancy metric measures the quality of the RAG pipeline’s generator by evaluating how relevant the actual output of LLM is compared to the provided query.
Faithfulness: This metric measures the quality of your RAG pipeline’s generator by evaluating whether the actual output factually aligns with the contents of your retrieval context.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Limitations of RAG
Recent findings [21] show that optimal choice of retrieval method and LLM is task-dependent and choice of retrieval method often impacts performance more than scaling LLM size. While the hybrid retrieval performs better on the proprietary dataset across almost all metrics (Table 1), it still performs poorly on contextual relevancy across all datasets. On an average, more than half of the context retrieved is not relevant to the user query or that the information is sparse meaning only few chunks contain relevant information. Besides, many times there are instances where the LLM fails to answer user queries even when the information to generate the answer is in the retrieved context.

3.2 Efficacy of Distance Approach
As discussed in Section 3.1, classical RAG based on hybrid retriever fails to answer many questions with sparse information even after varying the chunk size and top-k values. However, the usage of distance approach in information retrieval augments the classical RAG and LLM is able to respond to such questions with accurate answers every time, as shown in Table LABEL:table:_table2. Thus, distance approach augmented RAG performs without the need to use a more advanced LLM with higher context window and thereby saving cost (All responses in Table LABEL:table:_table2 are generated using GPT-3.5-TURBO).

The above examples in Table LABEL:table:_table2, demonstrate that how distance approach can effectively answer questions with no compromise in response time. For example, the answer from hybrid retrieval in the 4th question fails to answer who the CEO of D-Labs is but mentions that it has information about the Assistant Program Manager at AIC ISB. However upon asking that question we see that it doesn’t answer the question but just describes the role. On the other hand, using the distance approach we are able to retrieve the most relevant context and then the LLM is able to generate the answer successfully.
4 Proposed Algorithm
The proposed algorithm helps address the problem of time spent in information retrieval of sparse information during inference from the a large corpus of chunks T??Titalic_T. It solves for this by identifying a priori all chunks which correspond to sparse information and then, creating a sub-set of these chunks such that S?T????S\subseteq Titalic_S ? italic_T. Rest of the chunks form the set R??Ritalic_R such that R?T????R\subseteq Titalic_R ? italic_T Thus, one does not have to sequentially search all the text chunks to identify the most relevant chunks when the hybrid retrieval fails in retrieving relevant context. In this case, the algorithm switches to the distance approach and searches in the set of sparse chunks (S??Sitalic_S) only, thereby reducing the time to retrieve compared to searching for all the chunks.

5 Conclusion
There have been many methods to improve retrieval in recent publications [22] making information retrieval one of the most active areas of research in Information Theory. Our experiments demonstrate that RAG over proprietary datasets is far more challenging than open source datasets prepared for evaluation as it fails to provide satisfactory answers for sparse information. However, enterprises cannot afford to have an information retrieval solution which prevents LLMs from providing the correct response generation. This is where the distance approach can complement information retrieval of classical thereby allowing one to explore the full potential of LLMs in generating quality answers every time. We would like put forward our findings in the following key points:
•
The experiment demonstrates that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on proprietary datasets poses significant challenges compared to open-source datasets.
•
Classical RAG with hybrid retrieval often fail to provide satisfactory responses when dealing with sparse information, impacting the efficiency and reliability of information retrieval.
•
A distance-based approach is proposed to complement hybrid retrieval, enhancing the overall retrieval process by focusing on sparse chunks of information.
•
Experiments confirm that distance approach does not compromise on quality of responses in scenarios where answers generated by LLM using context pulled using hybrid retrieval fail.
•
The findings suggest that integrating the distance approach into classical RAG can unlock the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring accurate and efficient information retrieval for enterprise specific data.
